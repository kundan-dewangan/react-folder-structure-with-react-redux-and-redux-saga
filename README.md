# Reactjs folder structure with react-redux and redux-saga

If you are just getting started with React, you are probably using create-react-app as your toolchain. After Create react App make the following folder structure.

<div style="display: flex">

<img src="/public/assets/img/first.png" height="400" width="auto">

<img src="/public/assets/img/second.png" height="400" width="auto">

<img src="/public/assets/img/third.png" height="400" width="auto">

</div>

## Redux
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to Facebook's Flux architecture

Redux-Saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures
